# Python-Spotify-Project
Python based project with the purpose of interacting with the Spotify API to generate audio features for a given playlist and train machine learning models on the data

(Full detailed write-up coming soon)

**Note:** API keys are hidden from this repo for security purposes and exist in a .env file locally.

## Learning Objectives:
Client credential user flow from Spotify

Testing of different hyperparameters for several ML models

Evaluation of the models against a validation set and a seperate test set

Creation of a data set based on Spotify data as well as sourced elsewhere

Improvement on previous attempts and better evaluation using more relevant metrics

Heavy use of Python rather than JS, CSS, or HTML to align with career goals
